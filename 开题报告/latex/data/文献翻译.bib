 abstract={Abstract We propose fLDA, a novel matrix factorization method to predict ratings in recommender system applications where a \bag-of-words" representation for item meta-data is natu- ral. Such scenarios are commonplace in web applications like content recommendation, ad targeting and web search where items are articles, ads and web pages respectively. Because of data sparseness, regularization is key to good predictive accuracy. Our method works by regularizing both user and item factors simultaneously through user features and the bag of words associated with each item. Speciflcally, each word in an item is associated with a discrete latent factor often referred to as the topic of the word; item topics are obtained by averaging topics across all words in an item. Then, user rating on an item is modeled as user's a-nity to the item's topics where user a-nity to topics (user factors) and topic assignments to words in items (item factors) are learned jointly in a supervised fashion. To avoid overfltting, user and item factors are regularized through Gaussian lin- ear regression and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) priors respectively. We show our model is accurate, interpretable and handles both cold-start and warm-start scenarios seam- lessly through a single model. The e-cacy of our method is illustrated on benchmark datasets and a new dataset from Yahoo! Buzz where fLDA provides superior predictive ac- curacy in cold-start scenarios and is comparable to state-of- the-art methods in warm-start scenarios. As a by-product, fLDA also identifles interesting topics that explains user- item interactions. Our method also generalizes a recently proposed technique called supervised LDA (sLDA) to col- laborative flltering applications. While sLDA estimates item topic vectors in a supervised fashion for a single regression, fLDA incorporates multiple regressions (one for each user) in estimating the item factors.},

On the other hand, in this context there are sides to recommendation quality requiring further characterisation and methodological research 鈥 a gap that is acknowledged in the field. We present a comparative study on the influence that different types of information available in social systems have on item recommendation. Aiming to identify which sources of user interest evidence 鈥 tags, social contacts, and user-item interaction data 鈥 are more effective to achieve useful recommendations, and in what aspect, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering, and social recommenders on three datasets obtained from Delicious, Last.fm, and MovieLens. Aiming to determine whether and how combining such information sources may enhance over individual recommendation approaches, we extend the common accuracy-oriented evaluation practice with various metrics to measure further recommendation quality dimensions, namely coverage, diversity, novelty, overlap, and relative diversity between ranked item recommendations. We report empiric observations showing that exploiting tagging information by content-based recommenders provides high coverage and novelty, and combining social networking and collaborative filtering information by hybrid recommenders results in high accuracy and diversity. This, along with the fact that recommendation lists from the evaluated approaches had low overlap and relative diversity values between them, gives insights that meta-hybrid recommenders combining the above strategies may provide valuable, balanced item suggestions in terms of performance and non-performance metrics.},

 abstract={The development of social network has increased the importance of social recommendation. However, social recommender systems have only recently been given research attention. Social relationships between users, especially trust relationships, can facilitate the design of social recommender systems. Such systems are based on the idea that users linked by a social network tend to share similar interests. Existing recommender approaches based on social trust relationships do not fully utilize such relationships and thus have low prediction accuracy or slow convergence speed. We propose a factor analysis approach that explicitly and implicitly uses social trust relationships simultaneously to overcome this limitation and fully utilize social trust relationships. Our approach combines the advantages of the existing two approaches, social recommendation using probabilistic matrix factorization and learning to recommend with social trust ensemble. Based on Epinions data sets, our approach has both significantly higher prediction accuracy and convergence speed than traditional collaborative filtering technology and state-of-the-art trust-based recommendation approaches.},

 abstract={Abstract Online social networking sites have become popular platforms on which users can link with each other and share information, not only basic rating information but also information such as contexts, social relationships, and item contents. However, as far as we know, no existing works systematically combine diverse types of information to build more accurate recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware hierarchical Bayesian method. First, we propose the use of spectral clustering for user-item subgrouping, so that users and items in similar contexts are grouped. We then propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian model that can make predictions for each user-item subgroup, our model incorporate not only topic modeling to mine item content but also social matrix factorization to handle ratings and social relationships. Experiments on an Epinions dataset show that our method significantly improves recommendation performance compared with six categories of state-of-the-art recommendation methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and recall. We have also conducted experiments to study the extent to which ratings, contexts, social relationships, and item contents contribute to recommendation performance in terms of prediction accuracy and recall.

 abstract={Personalized tag recommendation systems recommend a list of tags to a user when he is about to annotate an item. It exploits the individual preference and the characteristic of the items. Tensor factorization tech- niques have been applied to many applications, such as tag recommendation. Models based on Tucker Decomposition can achieve good performance but require a lot of computation power. On the other hand, mod- els based on Canonical Decomposition can run in linear time and are more feasible for online recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for personalized tag recommendation, which can be considered as a nonlinear extension of Canonical Decomposition. Different from linear tensor factorization, we exploit Gaussian radial basis function to increase the model鈥檚 capacity. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for tag recommendation on real datasets and perform well even with a small number of features, which verifies that our models can make better use of features.},

 abstract={ABSTRACT  Recommender systems are becoming tools of choice to select the online information relevant to a given user. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users that have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets, the public domain Epinions.com dataset and a much larger dataset that we have recently crawled from Flixster.com. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling trust propagation leads to a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy, in particular for cold start users.},

 abstract={Recommender systems provide users with personalized suggestions for products or services. These systems often rely on Collaborating Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-K recommendation task.},

While both methods have their own advantages, individually they fail to provide good recommendations in many situations. Incorporating components from both methods, a hybrid recommender system can overcome these shortcomings. In this paper, we present an elegant and effective framework for combining content and collaboration. Our approach uses a content-based predictor to enhance existing user data, and then provides personalized suggestions through collaborative filtering. We present experimental results that show how this approach, Content-Boosted Collaborative Filtering, performs better than a pure content-based predictor, pure collaborative filter, and a naive hybrid approach. We also discuss methods to improve the performance of our hybrid system.},

 abstract={ABSTRACT  Recently, tag recommendation (TR) has become a very hot research topic in data mining and related areas. However, neither co-occurrence based meth-ods which only use the item-tag matrix nor content based methods which only use the item content in-formation can achieve satisfactory performance in real TR applications. Hence, how to effectively combine the item-tag matrix, item content informa-tion, and other auxiliary information into the same recommendation framework is the key challenge for TR. In this paper, we first adapt the collabora-tive topic regression (CTR) model, which has been successfully applied for article recommendation, to combine both item-tag matrix and item content in-formation for TR. Furthermore, by extending CTR we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian model, called CTR with social regularization (CTR-SR), to seamlessly integrate the item-tag matrix, item content information, and social networks between items into the same principled model. Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models.},

Many existing approaches to recommender systems can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. Moreover, traditional recommender systems consider only the rating information, resulting in the loss of flexibility. Tagging has recently emerged as a popular way for users to annotate, organize and share resources on the Web. Several research tasks have shown that tags can represent userspsila judgments about Web contents quite accurately. In the light of the facts that both the rating activity and tagging activity can reflect userspsila opinions, this paper proposes a factor analysis approach called TagRec based on a unified probabilistic matrix factorization by utilizing both userspsila tagging information and rating information. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets. Furthermore, experimental results on MovieLens data set show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, with the growth of social tagging systems, users are easily overwhelmed by the large amount of data and it is very dif-ficult for users to dig out information that he/she is inter-ested in. Though the tagging system has provided interest-based social network features to enable the user to keep track of other users ’ tagging activities, there is still no automatic and effective way for the user to discover other users with common interests. In this paper, we propose a User Recom-mendation (UserRec) framework for user interest modeling and interest-based user recommendation, aiming to boost in-formation sharing among users with similar interests. Our work brings three major contributions to the research com-munity: (1) we propose a tag-graph based community de-tection method to model the users ’ personal interests, which are further represented by discrete topic distributions; (2) the similarity values between users ’ topic distributions are measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence), and the similarity values are further used to perform interest-based user recommendation; and (3) by analyzing users’ roles in a tagging system, we find users ’ roles in a tagging system are similar to Web pages in the Internet. Experiments on tagging dataset of Web pages (Yahoo! Delicious) show that UserRec outperforms other state-of-the-art recommender system approaches.},
