 abstract={Abstract Recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making personalized recommendations for information, products or services during a live interaction. These systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative filtering systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative filtering techniques. Itembased techniques first analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between different items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users. In this paper we analyze different item-based recommendation generation algorithms. We look into different techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vectors) and different techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). Finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. Our experiments suggest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time p...},

Tapestry is intended to handle any incoming stream of electronic documents and serves both as a mail filter and repository; its components are the indexer, document store, annotation store, filterer, little box, remailer, appraiser and reader/browser.

This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of neighborhood-based methods for the item recommendation problem. In particular, the main benefits of such methods, as well as their principal characteristics, are described. Furthermore, this document addresses the essential decisions that are required while implementing a neighborhood-based recommender system, and gives practical information on how to make such decisions. Finally, the problems of sparsity and limited coverage, often observed in large commercial recommender systems, are discussed, and a few solutions to overcome these problems are presented.},

 abstract={ABSTRACT  The explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender systems---a personalized information filtering technology used to identify a set of items that will be of interest to a certain user. User-based collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers, which in typical commercial applications can be several millions. To address these scalability concerns model-based recommendation techniques have been developed. These techniques analyze the user--item matrix to discover relations between the different items and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.In this article, we present one such class of model-based recommendation algorithms that first determines the similarities between the various items and then uses them to identify the set of items to be recommended. The key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items, and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item. Our experimental evaluation on eight real datasets shows that these item-based algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional user-neighborhood based recommender systems and provide recommendations with comparable or better quality.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

 abstract={A common task of recommender systems is to improve customer experience through personalized recommendations based on prior implicit feedback. These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model.},

The review text, however, contains rich information, which can be utilized to alleviate data sparsity limitations, and interpret transfer patterns. In this paper, we investigate how to utilize the review text to improve cross-domain collaborative filtering models. The challenge lies in the existence of non-linear properties in some transfer patterns. Given this, we extend previous transfer learning models in collaborative filtering, from linear mapping functions to non-linear ones, and propose a cross-domain recommendation framework with the review text incorporated. Experimental verifications have demonstrated, for new users with sparse feedback, utilizing the review text obtains 10% improvement in the AUC metric, and the nonlinear method outperforms the linear ones by 4%.},

 abstract={We propose a novel latent factor model to accurately predict response for large scale dyadic data in the presence of features. Our approach is based on a model that predicts response as a multiplicative function of row and column latent factors that are estimated through separate regressions on known row and column features. In fact, our model provides a single unified framework to address both cold and warm start scenarios that are commonplace in practical applications like recommender systems, online advertising, web search, etc. We provide scalable and accurate model fitting methods based on Iterated Conditional Mode and Monte Carlo EM algorithms. We show our model induces a stochastic process on the dyadic space with kernel (covariance) given by a polynomial function of features. Methods that generalize our procedure to estimate factors in an online fashion for dynamic applications are also considered. Our method is illustrated on benchmark datasets and a novel content recommendation application that arises in the context of Yahoo! Front Page. We report significant improvements over several commonly used methods on all datasets.},

The idea behind such models is that attitudes or preferences of a user are determined by a small number of unobserved factors. In a linear factor model, a user's preferences are modeledby linearly combining item factor vectors using user-specific coefficients. For example, for N usersand M movies, the N * M preference matrix R is given by the product of an N * D user coefficientmatrix},
