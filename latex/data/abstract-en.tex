\chapter{Abstract}

The popularity of tagging systems provides effective ways to improve the performance of recommendation algorithms. The tags assigned by users to items contain rich information, which can be utilized to alleviate data sparsity limitations. Most existing approaches focus modeling tags and ratings on single domain, they overlook an important property that tags link different domains as a bridge. 

In this paper, we propose a novel tag and rating based cross-domain collaborative filtering model, which first uses topic modeling to mine the semantic information of tags labelled for items, and then incorporates the semantic information into matrix factorization to factorize rating information. At last, we investigate how to utilize the bridging feature of tags between totally different domains to improve the rating prediction task in target domain.

Experiments conducted on two popular real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms the conventional CF approach, the state-of-the-art tag and rating based CF approach in terms of both RMSE and MAE, and it is an effective approach to the data sparsity and the cold-start problem.
